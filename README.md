# UIUC-EHR-Safari-Recreation
Our repository for our CS 598 Final Project, where we aim to recreate "EHR Safari: Data is Contextual"

<strong>EHR Safari Reproduction Plan</strong>

Start Date: March 17, 2025
End Date: April 25, 2025 (Finalization & Submission)

<strong>Phase 1: Setup & Data Exploration (March 17 – March 27)</strong>

✅ March 17 - 20

- Ensure both team members have access to MIMIC-III (complete required training if not done).
- Set up a shared repository for code and documentation.  
- Verify dataset integrity and preprocessing requirements.
- Extract heart rate measurements and begin exploratory data analysis (EDA).

✅ March 21 - 27

- Replicate heart rate anomaly findings (e.g., patients with 3 beats/sec).
- Identify inconsistencies and begin drafting notes on initial findings.
- 
Checkpoint: First EDA insights documented; preliminary findings on heart rate and admission time quirks.

<strong>Phase 2: Deeper Analysis & Replicating Key Findings (March 28 – April 7)</strong>

✅ March 28 - April 3

- Graph WBC values over time for patients; analyze time-based variations in lab values.
- Identify patterns where WBC levels go from normal → abnormal → normal.
- Extract and analyze provider notes for duplication issues.
- Ask: Do we see duplicated notes affecting recorded clinical events?
- Implement deduplication strategies and document their effects.
  
✅ April 4 - 7

- Conduct pairwise field correlation analysis in MIMIC.
- Formulate and test scenarios where fields are swapped (e.g., what happens if ICU admission date is swapped with discharge date?).
- Assess how race-based disparities in care might appear in MIMIC (e.g., documentation biases).
  
Checkpoint: Replication of data quirks nearly complete. Prepare a draft of results with preliminary visualizations. 

<strong>Phase 3: Critiquing Published Work & Reproducibility (April 8 – April 17)</strong>

✅ April 8 - 12

- Review the original two published papers critiqued in EHR Safari.
- Conduct internal analysis: How do our findings compare with the paper’s claims?
- Conduct external analysis: What subsequent papers cited these findings, and did they misinterpret them?
  
✅ April 13 - 17

- Draft a structured critique of the assumptions made in the original papers.
- Evaluate potential methodological flaws (e.g., improper data cleaning, unvalidated assumptions).
  
Checkpoint: Comparison with published works completed. Start assembling our final report.

<strong>Phase 4: Finalizing Paper & Submission (April 18 – April 25) </strong>

✅ April 18 - 21

- Refine all visualizations, tables, and key takeaways.
- Structure the final report according to AAAI LaTeX format.
- Perform peer review within the team—swap sections for feedback.
  
✅ April 22 - 25

- Address feedback and polish the final draft.
- Ensure code & dataset documentation is clear and reproducible.
- Submit the project and prepare for any possible presentation or follow-up discussion.
  
<strong>Final Deliverables by April 25:</strong>
- Full reproduction paper with results and insights as well as recorded video.
- Replicated EDA figures and dataset quirks.
- Comparison to original work, highlighting gaps or limitations.
- Fully documented code repository for transparency and reproducibility.
